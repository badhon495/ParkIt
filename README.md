## Setting up SMTP Mail for Forgot Password

To enable the forgot password email feature, configure your SMTP settings in the `.env` file. For Gmail SMTP, add the following lines:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your mail
MAIL_PASSWORD=password without any gap
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your mail
MAIL_FROM_NAME="ParkIt"
```

You can get the app password from (App Password)[https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/apppasswords]. Make sure to replace `your mail` and `password without any gap` with your actual Gmail address and app password, respectively.
You can also use other SMTP providers like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc. Just replace the `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, and other relevant fields with the appropriate values for your SMTP provider.
After updating `.env`, run:
```bash
php artisan config:cache
php artisan config:clear
```

**Note:**
- If you use 2-Step Verification on your Gmail, you must use an App Password instead of your regular password.
- Make sure to allow access for less secure apps or use App Passwords in your Google account settings.
- You can check the website from the ParkIt [https://parkit-2arc.onrender.com] to see the working of the project. As it is hosted on Render free tier, it may take some time to load the website.
